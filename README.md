Basic: 

    • Searchable (filter) directory of monsters
        ◦ Scroll
        ◦ keyword searchable
    • select monsters for import into new/existing encounters
        ◦ edit and modify new encounters
            ▪ display: max hp, ac, passive perception, imunities
        ◦ store encounters
            ▪ display key stats for monsters
    • Display full stats for monsters (easy look up) 
    • Homebrew: Form that you fill out to add characters or custom monsters and that would append to the monster data.
